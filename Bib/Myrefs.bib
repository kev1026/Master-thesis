abstract = {This paper addresses the practical problem of obtaining convergence$\backslash$nto steady state solutions of the Euler equations when limiters are$\backslash$nused in conjunction with upwind schemes on unstructured grids. The$\backslash$nbase scheme forms a gradient and limits it by imposing monotonicity$\backslash$nconditions in the reconstruction stage. It is shown by analysis in$\backslash$none dimension that such an approach leads to various schemes meeting$\backslash$ntotal-variation-diminishing requirements in one dimension. In multiple$\backslash$ndimensions these schemes produce steady-state solutions that are$\backslash$nmonotone and devoid of oscillations. However, convergence stalls$\backslash$nafter a few orders of reduction in the residual. A new limiter is$\backslash$nintroduced that is particularly suited for unstructured grid applications.$\backslash$nWhen reduced to one dimension, it is shown that this limiter satisfies$\backslash$nthe standard theory.

abstract = {A class of fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes based on Hermite polynomials, termed HWENO (Hermite WENO) schemes, for solving one dimensional non-linear hyperbolic conservation law systems, was developed and applied as limiters for the Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) methods in [J. Comput. Phys. 193 (2003) 115]. In this paper, we extend the method to solve two dimensional non-linear hyperbolic conservation law systems. The emphasis is again on the application of such HWENO finite volume methodology as limiters for RKDG methods to maintain compactness of RKDG methods. Numerical experiments for two dimensional Burgers' equation and Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics are presented to show the effectiveness of these methods. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, we are able to show that the discontinuous Galerkin methods satisfy a cell entropy inequality for square entropy (in semidiscrete sense) if the multi-dimensional systems are symmetric. Similar result [Jiang and Shu (1994) Math. Comput. 62, 531--538] was obtained for scalar equations in multi-dimensions.

abstract = {Weak solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws are not uniquely determined by their initial values; an entropy condition is needed to pick out the physically relevant solutions. The question arises whether finite difference approximations converge to this particular solution. It is known that this is not always the case with the standard Lax-Wendroff (L-W) difference scheme. In this paper a simple variant of the L-W scheme is devised which retains its desirable computational features---conservation form, three point scheme, second-order accuracy on smooth solutions, but which has the additional property that limit solutions satisfy the entropy condition. This variant is constructed by adding a simple nonlinear artificial viscosity to the usual L-W operator. The nature of the viscosity is deduced by first analyzing a model differential equation derived from the truncation error for the L-W operator, keeping only terms of order ($\Delta$x)2. Furthermore, this viscosity is ``switched on'' only when sufficiently steep discrete gradients develop in the approximate solution: The full L-W scheme is then shown to have the desired property provided that the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy restriction |$\lambda$f′(u)|≤0.14 is satisfied.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpa.3160320605/abstract;jsessionid=AB5CD6D392DE8BF3F89A9EE6C798C5EB.f02t02},

abstract = {Review From the reviews: .,."There are interesting and non-standard topics that are not usually included in a first course in measture-theoretic probability including Markov Chains and MCMC, the bootstrap, limit theorems for martingales and mixing sequences, Brownian motion and Markov processes. The material is well-suported with many end-of-chapter problems." D.L. McLeish for Short Book Reviews of the ISI, December 2006 "The reader sees not only how measure theory is used to develop probability theory, but also how probability theory is used in applications. a The discourse is delivered in a theorem proof format and thus is better suited for classroom a .

It consists of 18 chapters. Every chapter contains many well chosen examples and ends with several problems related to the earlier developed theory (some with hints). a At the very end of the book there is an appendix collecting necessary facts from set theory, calculus and metric spaces. The authors suggest a few possibilities on how to use their book." (Kazimierz Musial, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1125 (2), 2008) "The title of the book consists of the names of its two basic parts. The booka (TM)s third part is comprised of some special topics from probability theory. a The authors suggest using the book intwo-semester graduate programs in statistics or a one-semester seminar on special topics.

(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes. From the reviews: "...There are interesting and non-standard topics that are not usually included in a first course in measture-theoretic probability including Markov Chains and MCMC, the bootstrap, limit theorems for martingales and mixing sequences, Brownian motion and Markov processes. The material is well-suported with many end-of-chapter problems." D.L. McLeish for Short Book Reviews of the ISI, December 2006},

abstract = {The Runge--Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) method is a high order finite element method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. It uses ideas from high resolution finite volume schemes, such as the exact or approximate Riemann solvers, total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge--Kutta time discretizations, and limiters. It has the advantage of flexibility in handling complicated geometry, h-p adaptivity, and efficiency of parallel implementation, and has been used successfully in many applications. However, the limiters used to control spurious oscillations in the presence of strong shocks are less robust than the strategies of essentially nonoscillatory (ENO) and weighted ENO (WENO) finite volume and finite difference methods. In this paper we investigate using WENO finite volume methodology as limiters for RKDG methods, with the goal of obtaining a robust and high order limiting procedure to simultaneously obtain uniform high order accuracy and sharp, nonoscillatory shock transition for RKDG methods....},

The key idea of such limiters is to use the entire polynomials of the DG solutions from the troubled cell and its immediate neighboring cells, and then apply the classical WENO procedure to form a convex combination of these polynomials based on smoothness indicators and nonlinear weights, with suitable adjustments to guarantee conservation. The main advantage of this new limiter is its simplicity in implementation, especially for the unstructured meshes considered in this paper, as only information from immediate neighbors is needed and the usage of complicated geometric information of the meshes is largely avoided. Numerical results for both scalar equations and Euler systems of compressible gas dynamics are provided to illustrate the good performance of this procedure. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to summarize our recent progress in high-order and high accurate CFD methods for flow problems with complex grids as well as to discuss the engineering prospects in using these methods. Despite the rapid de- velopment of high-order algorithms in CFD, the applications of high-order and high accurate methods on complex configurations are still limited. One of the main rea- sonswhich hinder thewidely applications of thesemethods is the complexity of grids. Many aspectswhich can be neglected for low-order schemesmust be treated carefully for high-order oneswhen the configurations are complex. In order to implement high- order finite difference schemes on complexmulti-block grids, the geometric conserva- tion lawand block-interface conditions are discussed. Aconservativemetricmethod is applied to calculate the grid derivatives, and a characteristic-based interface condition is employed to fulfil high-order multi-block computing. The fifth-order WCNS-E-5 proposed by Deng [9, 10] is applied to simulate flows with complex grids, including a double-delta wing, a transonic airplane configuration, and a hypersonic X-38 con- figuration. The results in this paper and the references show pleasant prospects in engineering-oriented applications of high-order schemes.

abstract = {The multislope concept has been recently introduced in the literature to deal with MUSCL reconstructions on triangular and tetrahedral unstructured meshes in the finite volume cell-centered context. Dedicated scalar slopes are used to compute the interpolations on each face of a given element, in opposition to the monoslope methods in which a unique limited gradient is used. The multislope approach reveals less expensive and potentially more accurate than the classical gradient techniques. Besides, it may also help the robustness when dealing with hyperbolic systems involving complex solutions, with large discontinuities and high density ratios. However some important limitations on the mesh topology still have to be overcome with the initial multislope formalism. In this paper, a generalized multislope MUSCL method is introduced for cell-centered finite volume discretizations. The method is freed from constraints on the mesh topology, thereby operating on completely general unstructured meshes. Moreover optimal second-order accuracy is reached at the faces centroids. The scheme can be written with nonnegative coefficients, which makes it L???-stable. Special attention has also been paid to equip the reconstruction procedure with well-adapted dedicated limiters, potentially CFL-dependent. Numerical tests are provided to prove the ability of the method to deal with completely general meshes, while exhibiting second-order accuracy.},

The novel edge-based MUSCL scheme is devised to construct the required values at the midpoint of cell edges in a more straightforward and effective way compared to other conventional approaches, by making better use of the geometrical property of the triangular grids. The scheme is incorporated into a two-dimensional (2D) cell-centered Godunov-type finite volume model as proposed in Hou etal. (2013a,c) to solve the shallow water equations (SWEs). The MUSCL scheme renders the model to preserve the well-balanced property and achieve high accuracy and efficiency for shallow flow simulations over uneven terrains. Furthermore, the scheme is directly applicable to all triangular grids. Application to several numerical experiments verifies the efficiency and robustness of the current new MUSCL scheme.},

The multi-dimensional limiting process (MLP) which has been successfully proposed on structured grids is extended to unstructured grids. The basic idea of the proposed limiting strategy is to control the distribution of both cell-centered and cell-vertex physical properties to mimic multi-dimensional nature of flow physics, which can be formulated to satisfy so called the MLP condition. The MLP condition can guarantee high-order spatial accuracy and improved convergence without yielding spurious oscillations. Starting from the MUSCL-type reconstruction on unstructured grids followed by the efficient implementation of the MLP condition, MLP slope limiters on unstructured meshes are obtained. Thanks to its superior limiting strategy and maximum principle satisfying characteristics, the newly developed MLP on unstructured grids is quite effective in controlling numerical oscillations as well as accurate in capturing multi-dimensional flow features. Numerous test cases are presented to validate the basic features of the proposed approach. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In previous works, the MLP was shown to possess several superior characteristics, such as the ability to control multi-dimensional oscillation efficiently and to capture both discontinuous and continuous multi-dimensional flow features accurately within the finite volume framework. In particular, the oscillation-control mechanism in multiple dimensions was established by combining the local maximum principle and the multi-dimensional limiting (MLP) condition, leading to the formulation of efficient and accurate MLP-u slope limiters. The MLP limiting strategy is now extended to the higher-order DG framework to develop the hierarchical MLP formulation on unstructured grids, which facilitates the capturing of compressible flow structures very accurately. By combining the behavior of local extrema with the augmented MLP condition, the hierarchical MLP method (the MLP-based troubled-cell markers and the MLP limiters in the RKDG formulation) is developed for arbitrary DG- Pn polynomial approximations. Through extensive numerical analyses and computations on unstructured grids, it is demonstrated that the proposed hierarchical DG-MLP method yields outstanding performance in resolving non-compressive as well as compressive flow features. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Hierarchical multi-dimensional limiting process (MLP) is improved and extended for flux reconstruction or correction procedure via reconstruction (FR/CPR) on unstructured grids. MLP was originally developed in finite volume method (FVM) and it provides an accurate, robust and efficient oscillation-control mechanism in multiple dimensions for linear reconstruction. This limiting philosophy can be hierarchically extended into higher-order Pn approximation or reconstruction. The resulting algorithm is referred to as the hierarchical MLP and facilitates detailed capture of flow structures while maintaining formal order-of-accuracy in a smooth region and providing accurate non-oscillatory solutions across a discontinuous region. This algorithm was developed within modal DG framework, but it can also be formulated into a nodal framework, most notably the FR/CPR framework. Troubled-cells are detected by applying the MLP concept, and the final accuracy is determined by a projection procedure and the hierarchical MLP limiting step. Extensive numerical analyses and computations, ranging from two-dimensional to three-dimensional fluid systems, have demonstrated that the proposed limiting approach yields outstanding performances in capturing compressible inviscid and viscous flow features.},

主要的思想是利用重构的解定义一个局部极大值区域 (和 Buffard 的那篇文章有点像, 而 Buffard 那篇文章的思想有更早的源头 Hubbard 1999?) 在这个极大值区域里面求一个约束极值问题.

在多维的情形, DG 方法同样面临保持相同的精度的问题. 主要的困难就在于{\&}quot;多维{\&}quot;斜率限制器的设计. 合理的斜率限制器应该在控制非物理震荡的同时, 又可以避免添加人为的数值耗散.

在第五章里面我们简要的回顾一下之前的斜率限制器. 着重讲一下 Shu 和 Cockburn 的斜率限制器. (实际上在这一部分就只讲了 shu 和 Cockburn 的限制器)

Limiter 的思路不是主流的思路. 这篇文章里面所谓的限制不是限制 DG 的一阶量, 而是限制值本身. 不理解.},

abstract = {Despite their geometric flexibility, unstructured mesh schemes for compressible gas dynamics do not usually resolve captured shocks and contact discontinuities as well as corresponding structured mesh schemes. The main reason for this appears to be the difficulty in constructing analogous extensions to higher-order accuracy. This issue is addressed in some detail and a new, compact stencil, Maximum Limited Gradient (MLG) reconstruction technique is presented for unstructured elements. The MLG reconstruction turns out to be a multidimensional analogue of the one-dimensional Superbee slope. We then describe a simple and robust extension to systems of equations, which does not require any diagonalization of flux Jacobian matrices. An application to a blast wave hazard prediction problem is presented using the wave-by-wave extension of the MLG limiter to the Euler equations.},

We treat the spatial and temporal discretizations separately, hoping that it is easier to spot the similarities and differences of various types of methods. Our main focus is to present the basic design principles of each method, and highlight its pros and cons when appropriate. Sample computational results are shown to illustrate the capability of selected methods. These high-order methods are expected to be more efficient than low-order methods for problems requiring high accuracy, such as wave propagation problems, vortex-dominated flows including high-lift configuration, helicopter blade vortex interaction, as well as large eddy simulation and direct numerical simulation of turbulence. We conclude the paper with several current challenges in the proliferation of high-order methods in the aerospace community. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, we further analyze, test, modify and improve the high order WENO (weighted essentially non-oscillatory) finite difference schemes of Liu, Osher and Chan. It was shown by Liu et al. that WENO schemes constructed from the r-th order (in L1 norm) ENO schemes are (r+1)-th order accurate. We propose a new way of measuring the smoothness of a numerical solution, emulating the idea of minimizing the total variation of the approximation, which results in a 5-th order WENO scheme for the case r = 3, instead of the 4-th order with the original smoothness measurement by Liu et al. This 5-th order WENO scheme is as fast as the 4-th order WENO scheme of Liu et al., and both schemes are about twice as fast as the 4-th order ENO schemes on vector supercomputers and as fast on serial and parallel computers. For Euler systems of gas dynamics, we suggest computing the weights from pressure and entropy instead of the characteristic values to simplify the costly characteristic procedure. The resulting WENO schemes are about twice as fast as the WENO schemes using the characteristic decompositions to compute weights, and work well for problems which do not contain strong shocks or strong reflected waves. We also prove that, for conservation laws with smooth solutions, all WENO schemes are convergent. Many numerical tests, including the 1D steady state nozzle flow problem and 2D shock entropy wave interaction problem, are presented to demonstrate the remarkable capability of the WENO schemes, especially the WENO scheme using the new smoothness measurement, in resolving complicated shock and flow structures. We have also applied Yang's artificial compression method to the WENO schemes to sharpen contact discontinuities.},

@article{Dumbser2016,
abstract = {Abstract Hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDE) are a very powerful mathematical tool to describe complex dynamic processes in science and engineering. Very often, hyperbolic PDE can be derived directly from first principles in physics, such as the conservation of mass, momentum and energy. These principles are universally accepted to be valid and can be used for the simulation of a very wide class of different problems, ranging from astrophysics (rotating gas clouds, the merger of a binary neutron star system into a black hole and the associated generation and propagation of gravitational waves) over geophysics (generation and propagation of seismic waves after an earthquake, landslides, avalanches, tidal waves, storm surges, flooding and morphodynamics of rivers) to engineering (turbulent flows over aircraft and the associated noise generation and propagation, rotating flows in turbo-machinery, multi-phase liquid-gas flows in internal combustion engines) and computational biology (blood flow in the human cardio-vascular system).  It is of course impossible to cover all the above topics in a single special issue. However, all these apparently different applications have a common mathematical description under the form of nonlinear hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations, possibly containing also higher order derivative terms, non-conservative products and nonlinear (potentially stiff) source terms. From the mathematical point of view, the major difficulties in these systems arise due to the inherent nonlinearities and the formation of non-smooth solution features such as e.g. shock waves. The construction of robust and accurate numerical methods for such type of problems is even after decades of successful research an ongoing quest. This quest is fueled by recent advances in the development of novel methods with promising additional properties such as e.g. high spatial order on unstructured meshes, algorithmic simplicity for modern multi-core architectures and automatic mesh and/or trial function adaptation. The final goal is to construct methods that efficiently produce reliable results for such type of problems.  This special issue is dedicated to recent advances in numerical methods for such nonlinear systems of hyperbolic PDE and tries to cover a wide spectrum of different problems and numerical approaches.},
